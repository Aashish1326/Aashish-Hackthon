# Hackathon Project: Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning Model

### Task üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª

#### Step 1: Download the dataset from the link available above.

The dataset can be found in the 'data' folder of this repository. Please download it and use it for analysis and model building.

#### Step 2: Perform Proper Analysis of the Dataset

Before building the machine learning model, it's essential to understand the dataset. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights, handle missing values, and preprocess the data as needed. Use visualization tools and descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of the features and the target variable.

#### Step 3: Build a Machine Learning Model

Create a Machine Learning Model to predict the output based on the input column. You can choose the appropriate algorithm based on the nature of the problem (classification or regression). Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

#### Step 4: Bonus (Max Weightage) - Apply Data Preprocessing

For additional points, ensure you apply proper outlier detection and treatment techniques to handle any outliers present in the dataset. Perform feature engineering to extract meaningful insights and create new features that might improve the model's performance. Additionally, perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance further.

#### Step 5: Use Appropriate Evaluation Metrics and Compare Models

Evaluate the performance of all the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. For classification tasks, you can use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. For regression tasks, metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared can be used. Compare the models and analyze why one model outperforms the others, considering their strengths and weaknesses.

#### Step 6: Bonus (Max Weightage) - Build a Linear Regression Model

As an additional challenge, build a Linear Regression model by performing appropriate feature engineering. This will help you gain a better understanding of linear relationships between variables and serve as a good practice for regression tasks.



```

In the `notebooks` folder, create separate Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, machine learning model building, and the linear regression model. In the `src` folder, include Python scripts for data preprocessing, outlier detection, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
